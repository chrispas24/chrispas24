# Hello, World!
My name is Christian Pasamba, and I am an 18yo student at Rutgers University graduating in 2025.
I started studying Computer Science my sophomore year of high school, but have always been interested in computers and games from a young age. 
I plan on majoring in Computer Science at Rutgers and aim to work in the games industry. 

### What do I like to do?
I mostly enjoy programming games and tools for making games, although software engineering in general is very appealing to me. I also want to go on to teach programming, 
computer science, and game development eventually as a hobby or job.

I also enjoy producing music and making art.

### What do I know?
Most of my experience in C.S. has been mostly self taught, aside from a couple classes that I took in high school. 

I currently have experience programming in **Python**, **C++**, **C#**, and **Lua**. I also have very limited experience in **HTML** and **JavaScript**.

In terms of game development, I mostly like to work in frameworks like **MonoGame/XNA** and **Love2D**. I also spent about a year making games in **Game Maker Studio 2**. 

### What am I still learning? 
I'm still trying to refine my skills as a programmer, and expand my knowledge on programming and C.S. in general.

When it comes to game development, I am trying to get better at using a framework like **MonoGame** using **C#** to create my games.

On top of that, I hope to continue to refine my skills in **C++** and possibly even learning **Unreal Engine 4** as I know this it has become a standard in the gaming industry. 

### How can I contact you?
